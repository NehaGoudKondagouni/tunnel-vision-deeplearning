# Tunnel Vision : Deep Learning for Accident Detection in Low-Quality CCTV Footage 

### Overview 
Tunnel Vision is a deep learning-based project designed to detect accidents in tunnel environments using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes an image dataset for training a model to recognize accident scenarios effectively.



### Features

- Automatic detection of accidents in tunnel images
- Dataset handling and preprocessing
- Model training and validation

  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

- Google Colab Notebook

- Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images labeled for accident detection in tunnel environments. It is structured into training and validation sets.

## Model Training

The model is trained using deep learning techniques.

Evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss tracking.
